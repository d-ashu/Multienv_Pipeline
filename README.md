# Designing a CI/CD pipeline for an application with multi-environment deployment across Dev, Test, and Prod using Azure Pipeline.

Pipeline Overview
Stages: Build, Test, Deploy.

Environment Strategy:
Frontend: Build and deploy frontend code.
Backend: Build and deploy backend services.
Database: Manage database migrations or updates.
Infrastructure: AKS cluster for each environment (or namespaces within the same AKS).
Secrets Management: Use Azure Key Vault for managing sensitive data.

Store Kubernetes manifests (k8s/frontend.yaml, k8s/backend.yaml) for deploying your application in the cluster.
Use different namespaces (dev, preprod, prod) for isolating environments within the AKS cluster.
